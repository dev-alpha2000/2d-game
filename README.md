Dynamic Obstacles: Implement real-time interactions between the player and the environment.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's score as they collect items or progress through levels.
Collision Detection: Detect interactions between the player and other objects.
Responsive Design: The game scales and responds to different screen sizes, allowing for mobile and desktop play.
