## Overview

This project is a 2D Game built using React and JavaScript. It showcases basic game development concepts such as rendering graphics, managing game states, player movement, and collision detection within a React-based application.

The game may involve simple mechanics like player movement, collecting items, avoiding obstacles, or interacting with enemies.

## Features

Player Controls: Move the player character using keyboard or touch controls.

Dynamic Obstacles: Implement real-time interactions between the player and the environment.

Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's score as they collect items or progress through levels.

Collision Detection: Detect interactions between the player and other objects.

Responsive Design: The game scales and responds to different screen sizes, allowing for mobile and desktop play.


## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2d-game-app.git
cd 2d-game-app
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The game will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Game Mechanics

Player Movement: Control the player character using keyboard arrow keys (or touch controls on mobile).

Obstacles: The player must avoid or interact with dynamic obstacles within the game space.

Score: The score increases as the player progresses or collects specific items.

Game Over: The game will end if the player collides with certain objects or fails to complete a level.

Restart: After the game ends, the player can restart the game and try again.


## Example
When you open the game:

The player character appears on the screen, controlled by arrow keys or touch controls.

The game starts, and the player navigates the game world, avoiding obstacles and collecting items.

If the player reaches a certain score or completes the level, they win. Otherwise, if they collide with an enemy or obstacle, it's game over.

## Dependencies

React: Frontend framework for building the UI.

JavaScript Canvas API: (Optional) For rendering 2D graphics.

CSS or Styled Components: For styling the game interface..
